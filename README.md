Hello Azure expert!

This repo is the home for all migAz tools. migAz intent is to help you on Azure deployments and migrations.

The base principal of migAz tools is to work on top of ARM templates. This creates the foundations for you to create, change and migrate deployments with the power and flexibility of ARM templates deployment model. This is true if you are now starting to work with ARM templates and want to learn, or you already have advanced knowledge but need a tool to make you even more productive.

All versions (except ASM Native) work the same way. Connects to the source environment, allows you to select the objects you need to export and create an ARM template from it. With this ARM template you can now make changes, clone or migrate an environment.
Have a look to each ASM, ARM and AWS versions and see where it helps you.

Give us feedback so we continue to improve this tools and, specially, help us by submitting your own updates. Remember this are community tools that depend deeply on your feedback and code contributions.
