The use of this Releases folder has been discontinued and will be removed in the future; however, it has been retained for now to raise awareness that all MigAz releases (starting with v2.4.0.0) will be created as GitHub "Releases".  If you are looking for a compiled build of a MigAz Release, you will now find those attached to the GitHub Release.  Please visit the [MigAz GitHub Release](https://github.com/Azure/migAz/releases) page.
